# Models

Machine learning models for genomic analysis and risk prediction.

## Model Types

### 1. Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS)
- Disease-specific PRS calibrated for Indian populations
- Longevity scores based on centenarian genetics

### 2. Protein Pathogenicity Predictors
- Variant effect prediction models
- Protein stability classifiers
- Aggregation propensity models

### 3. Healthspan Prediction
- Multi-modal models combining genomics + phenotype
- Time-to-event models for age-related diseases

## Training Data

- Indian population genomic data (GenomeIndia, IndiGen)
- UK Biobank (for baseline models)
- ClinVar (pathogenic variant labels)
- Centenarian cohorts
